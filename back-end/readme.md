# Back End Engineering Challenge

GACon is looking for someone to design a RESTful JSON API for data for talks at a conference and attendees. Some sample data is included in data.json.

## Requirements:

- Demonstrate use of REST conventions  
- Include routes to:  
	- get a list of all talks
	- get a list of all attendees

## Bonuses:

- Use appropriate HTTP status codes.  
- Include a route to add an attendee to a talk.

## Note:

Please document how to test your API with `curl` commands; there is no need to build out views.
