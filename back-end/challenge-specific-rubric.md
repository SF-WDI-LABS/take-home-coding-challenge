# Back End Engineering Challenge - Rubric

GACon is looking for someone to design a RESTful API for data for talks at a conference and attendees. Some sample data is included in data.json.


## Some of our most successful candidates...


**Communicate using appropriate technical terms.**   

  - Demonstrate knowledge of *RESTful* conventions

  - Create the specified API routes/endpoints (know what *API* and *route* mean) **and** list the endpoints in documentation.

  - Write properly-formatted `curl` commands for the required routes.

**Demonstrate knowledge of software construction patterns and best practices.**
  
  - Use object oriented programming to create data structures mirroring talks and attendees. 
  	
  - Create RESTful routes of the form:

  	- GET baseurl/talks to see all talks  
  	- GET baseurl/attendees to see all attendees  

  - Bonus: include (and document) other routes to interact with talk or attendee data.


**Consider design and implementation alternatives and make decisions based on relevant characteristics of the problem and available tools.**

  - Describe the back-end framework or technologies used and list a benefit or benefits of the technology chosen. 
  
  - Decide how to host and display the API and document this decision.

  - Either create a database or document that a database would be used in a real-world scenario.
  
  - Bonus: read or load data from data.json programmatically.

**Demonstrate awareness of real-world technical development practices and of concerns related to the target company, including testing and security.**

  - Follow the format of data provided in data.json. Data may be added but no fields should be removed, especially without reasons in the documentation. 
  
  - Test the API before submitting, and describe your the testing process.  Bonus: describe how API tests could be automated.

  - Connect the coding challenge to GACon by mentioning attendee privacy, accuracy of timestamps for users from various timezones, or some other thoughtful feature.
