# Take-Home Coding Challenge Workshop

Take-home coding challenge workshop resources live here. Notes from the slides are in [notes.md](notes.md).  The challenge itself is below. 

## Workflow

The company you're interviewing with has given you two hours to submit your work.  All submissions should include source code and a readme that explains how their reviewers should download and run the code.  To submit, they have asked that you provide a link to your work hosted on GitHub.

## Front-End 

[Front-end challenge](front-end): Build a responsive navbar with login/logout.

## Back-End

[Back-end challenge](back-end): Build a RESTful API for conference talks and attendees.

## Evaluation

Feel free to check out [this general feedback form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19AwHZFki1TTBjuz5-tn8Rrk25rmwioqnRZYpDR-hESU/edit?usp=sharing) (google doc) we'll use to go over your work.

Each challenge also includes a challenge-specific rubric you can reference as you evaluate your work. It will highlight extra steps that candidates might take on each challenge type.
