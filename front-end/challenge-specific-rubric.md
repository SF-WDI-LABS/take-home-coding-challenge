# Front End Engineering Challenge - Rubric


GA is piloting a program - GALAXY - to for high school students to access some online GA courses and workshops.

Use CSS, HTML, and JavaScript to develop a responsive navbar for GA's new young learner site. The navbar should include links to information for students, teachers, and parents, as well as a sign in / sign out link.

## Some of our most successful candidates...

**Meet all of the requirements in the prompt.**

**Communicate with potential employers using appropriate technical terms.**   

  - Make a *responsive* site (one that looks different - and good! - on different screen sizes).

  - Implement something that is identifiably a *navbar*.

  - Include at least one *breakpoint* where the layout changes.


**Demonstrate knowledge of software construction patterns and best practices.**

  - Strictly adhere to the style guidelines.

  - Encapsulate login/logout button feature in a function or functions so that changes required for future development are limited to one area.

  - Include a separate CSS file and link it properly in the head of the HTML document.

  - Include metadata like `<title>`, as well as charset, viewport, and description `<meta>` tags.

  - Bonus: Create a page that looks reasonable without JavaScript loaded ("progressive enhancement").



**Consider design and implementation alternatives and make decisions based on relevant characteristics of the problem and available tools.**


  - Consciously choose to use a front-end framework or library (or not) and document reasons for making that choice.   

  - If using a framework:  

    - follow conventions of that framework (very important: proper use of grid system).  

    - use the correct components from that framework (e.g.: Bootstrap's navbar, perhaps navbar-collapse).  

  - If not using a framework, use media queries to create responsive effect, and justify choice of breakpoint.   
  
  - Make changes in the mobile view that are consistent with UI design patterns - perhaps a hamburger menu, fewer images, etc.

  - Bonus: Include screenshots in the readme so it's easy to tell what was accomplished, at a glance.



**Demonstrate awareness of real-world technical development practices and concerns related to the target company, including testing and security.**  

  - Reference existing GA site design.

  - Improve the page with a clear indication of whether we're looking at "for students", "for parents", or "for teachers."
