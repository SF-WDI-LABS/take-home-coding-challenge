# Front End Engineering Challenge

GA is piloting a program - GALAXY - for high school students to access some online GA courses and workshops.

Use CSS, HTML, and JavaScript to develop a responsive navbar for GA's new young learner site. 

## Requirements:

- Demonstrate use of web standards including HTML5 with appropriate metadata.  
- Use an external stylesheet.   
- Make the navbar responsive with at least one breakpoint (your choice as to how it looks on a smaller screen width).   
- Follow the style guidelines listed below and the mockup image.  
- Include navbar links to information for students, teachers, and parents.
- Add buttons or links to login/logout.  Use JavaScript to control whether the login or the logout button is shown. Only one should be visible at a time.  
- Add a CSS animation - see [https://generalassemb.ly](https://generalassemb.ly/) for examples of how GA uses CSS animations in current sites.

## Bonuses

- Suggest and justify a change to some part of the mockup.
- Implement another section of the mockup.
- Use SASS or LESS and compile to CSS.   
- Show you know General Assembly's brand.

   - "Roboto" Google font for brand.
	 - Helvetica for other headers.
